# Lead_Scoring_Case_Study

# Problem Statement:

X Education is an education company that offers online courses for industry professionals. The company attracts many visitors to its website through various marketing channels, such as websites, search engines, and referrals. Some of these visitors fill out a form with their contact information and become leads for the company. The sales team then tries to convert these leads into customers by calling them, emailing them, etc. However, the company faces a problem: its lead conversion rate is very low. Out of 100 leads, only 30 become customers on average. This means that the sales team is wasting a lot of time and resources on leads that are not interested or ready to buy. 

# Business Objective:

Lead X wants us to build a model to give every lead a lead score between 0 -100 . So that they can identify the Hot leads and increase their conversion rate as well. The CEO want to achieve a lead conversion rate of 80%. They want the model to be able to handle future constraints as well like Peak time actions required, how to utilize full man power and after achieving target what should be the approaches.

# Goals of the Case Study:

Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.
